Obvious next steps, in order of increasing difficulty:
- Implement cursor API
- Fix red-black or splay tree implementation in cl-containers
- Figure out how to load from a snapshot
- Use with-transaction to improve performance
- Read transaction optimizations
- Remove controller object caching 
  (controller instance index already caches by definition)
